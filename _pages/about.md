## [About Me](https://about.me/vikas.lalwani)

- Software Engineer by profession, writer at heart. I have been working a lot around Data Streaming with Apache Kafka and DevOps (with Infrastructure as Code).  
- And in doing that I ended up working with Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Kubernetes and a lot more.  
- Part time (Technical) Product Management and full time engineering led to a role I never imagined I'd play in my career.
