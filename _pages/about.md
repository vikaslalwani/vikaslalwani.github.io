### I get things running, I keep them running

## [About Me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikaslalwani/) <span style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;"><a href="/assets/files/Vikas-Lalwani-SRE-Devops-Platform.pdf" download><img src="/assets/icons/download-pdf.png" alt="Download PDF" width="30" height="30"></a></span>

- Engineer by profession, writer at heart. 
- I have been building Data Streaming platforms with Apache Kafka, Internal developer platforms and stnadard SRE and DevOps (with Infrastructure as Code).  
- And in doing that I ended up working with Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Kubernetes and a lot more with data pipelines.  
- Part time (Technical) Product Management and full time engineering led to a role I never imagined I'd play in my career all while trying to expanding developer adoption to home baked systems
- Currently working on in-house MLOps setups and Kubernetes native dev platforms.

## Summary

- Designing REST and Event Driven solutions on kubernetes
- In-org customer interactions and product ownership
- Designing automations using serverless and Chatops patterns
- Scalable applications in Cloud (Hybrid with AWS primary)
- Kafka/ES/Cassandra at scale (1M+ tps), alongwith the infrastructure and operations for all of it.
- Setting up, automating and standardizing SRE and Devops deployment platforms
