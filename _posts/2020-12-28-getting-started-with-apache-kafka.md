## Kafka Overview

[Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) is an open source project for a distributed pub-sub messaging system designed as a distributed commit log.

Kafka stores messages in topics that are partitioned and replicated across multiple brokers in a cluster. Producers send messages to topics from which consumers read.
